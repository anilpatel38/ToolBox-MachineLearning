1. The general trend in the curve is that with more percentage of training data used and more trials, the higher the accuracy.

2. It looks like the very bottom has the most amount of noise, potentially because there is more randomness in the
   determination because of less training data being used to make an "educated guess."

3. About 1000 trials made a somewhat smooth curve after a few runs.

4. When I lowered C to 4**-3 the curve smooths out significantly and the accuracy is increased up towards 90%. I'm not 100% sure
   what this parameter does and how it affects the data.
